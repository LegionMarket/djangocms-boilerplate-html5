Aldryn HTML5 Boilerplate
========================

The webâ€™s most popular front-end template.

`HTML5 Boilerplate <http://html5boilerplate.com/>`_ helps you build fast, robust, and adaptable web apps or sites.
Kick-start your project with the combined knowledge and effort of 100s of developers,
all in one little package.

Up to date with `HTML5 Boilerplate <http://html5boilerplate.com/>`_ **5.3.0**.

This boilerplate is compatible with `Aldryn <http://www.aldryn.com/>`_.

.. note::

    In order to work with the Aldryn system, `main.css` and `index.html` needed to be renamed to
    `base.css` and `base.html`.


Auto Detected Files
-------------------

Files that are currently detected within the root of a website such as ``humans.txt`` or ``crossdomain.xml`` are
currently not supported by Aldryn. They are still integrated within this boilerplate and will work as soon as
the feature is available.
