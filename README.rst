HTML5 Boilerplate
=================

The webâ€™s most popular front-end template.

`HTML5 Boilerplate <http://html5boilerplate.com/>`_ helps you build fast, robust, and adaptable web apps or sites.
Kick-start your project with the combined knowledge and effort of 100s of developers,
all in one little package.

Up to date with `HTML5 Boilerplate <http://html5boilerplate.com/>`_ **5.3.0**.

This boilerplate is compatible with `Divio Cloud <http://www.divio.com/>`_.

.. note::

    In order to work with django CMS, `index.html` has been renamed to
    `base.html` and assets have been moved to the `static/` folder.


Auto Detected Files
-------------------

Files that are currently detected within the root of a website such as ``humans.txt`` or ``crossdomain.xml`` are
currently not supported by Divio. They are still integrated within this boilerplate and will work as soon as
the feature is available.


Documentation
-------------

You can find additional documentation on the django CMS within the `Divio Bootstrap 3 Boilerplate
<https://aldryn-boilerplate-bootstrap3.readthedocs.org>`_ or the `django CMS Documentation
<https://django-cms.readthedocs.org>`_.
